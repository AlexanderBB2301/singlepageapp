            <p>
              Ever thought about living on the Wirral? Do you know where the
              Wirral is? You'd be forgiven for saying no. You'd be forgiven, in
              fact, for asking where the Wirral even is. Last year, I would have
              answered no to the first two question and asked the third. And now
              I live here. A short car or ferry ride to Liverpool city center.
              Beaches, parks -including the famed Birkenhead park - watersports,
              country parks and a startling economic disparity between those
              living inside the M53 compared to those "across the road."
